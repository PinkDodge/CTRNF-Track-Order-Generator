# CTRNF-Track-Order-Generator
A really poorly programmed, rushed Python program that generates an order of tracks to play - good for people who host lobbies and want a nice way of picking tracks.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------
Kind of speaks for itself really, type the number to pick that option.
Then you'll be given a randomised order to play the tracks from whatever pool you select - if you don't like the order, you can generate a new one.
If you want to add/remove tracks from the lists, you can just edit them in/out.

Not a very good readme, but I dunno I just uploaded this for the sake of it really lmao

Also didn't test it much so it might be broken... I made this in a grand total of 5 minutes between races lol
