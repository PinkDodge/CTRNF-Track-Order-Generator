# CTRNF-Track-Order-Generator
A really poorly programmed, rushed Python program that generates an order of tracks to play - good for people who host lobbies and want a nice way of picking tracks.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------
Kind of speaks for itself really, type the number to pick that option.
If you want to add/remove tracks from the lists, you can just edit them in/out.

Not a very good readme, but I dunno I just uploaded this for the sake of it really lmao
